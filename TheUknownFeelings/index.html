                <h2>About the exhibition</h2>
                <p>
                    The purpose of this exhibition is to present the power of the words we use every day. Through words, we understand our world, we communicate with other people, we can express our opinion, identify and record our memories and experiences.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Words have the power to shape, create things and stories. According to modern linguists, there are about 7,000 languages, not including dialects. Each of them has different words and an idea to describe the same thing. However, there are exceptions to which this work is focused. In every language, there are words that cannot be translated into another language. This is because a country's culture is different from others. For the needs of certain events, situations or emotions, words are created that enable the inhabitants of a given country to communicate and express their feelings better and easier.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Most of the humanity lives in the world without realizing that certain feelings and situations have a name. Ignorance of the existence of these words causes people to lose the necessary parts of existence that could have changed the course of events in their lives. Untranslatable words have a force that changes, strengthens, and brings meaning and benefits to human life.
